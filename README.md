### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an amateur BSQ (Beat Saber Quest) modder, ROBLOX lua scripter, beginner HTML programmer, and former Beat Saber addict.

Some mods I've made are [PC Render Graphics](https://github.com/CGray1234/Quest-PC-Render-Graphics), [In-Game Text](https://github.com/CGray1234/InGameText), and [SqoreToggler](https://github.com/CGray1234/SqoreToggler).

Making PC mods soonâ„¢

I'll be making more mods in the future, so follow me to keep up with new mods!
